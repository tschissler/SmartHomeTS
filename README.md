# SmartHomeTS - demonstrating various technologies to make your home smarter

This project shows my ongoing efforts to make my home smarter to optimize for energy consumption by automation and visualization as well as adding some gadgets that are useful or fun.

This code is not designed to be used in many different scenarios and use cases but instead is tailoerd very spefically to my very situation (equipment, devices, needs etc.). 
I hope this still provides plenty of inspiration to others. 
Feel free to copy and use whatever you find useful from this repro.

# NOTE: kube-vip is intentionally NOT included here.
# Run configure-cluster.yml separately after k3s is stable.
# Reason: Running kube-vip immediately after k3s install can cause
# IP confusion and certificate issues. The two-phase approach is safer:
#   Phase 1: cluster.yml      → k3s install, wait for stability
#   Phase 2: configure-cluster.yml → kube-vip + add-ons

# Digital Energy Meter Sensor
This directory contains code to read data from a Digital energy sensor that sends consumption data via IR-signal.

The code is designed to run on a ESP32 microcontroller. In my case, I use an ESP32C6 which is available in a very small size.

Here you can see the schematic f√ºr wiring the sensor:

The 3D models to print a case are available at [../../3DModels/SMLSensor](../../3DModels/SMLSensor).
